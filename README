The aim of this project is to take working code used for data analysis and simplify it so that another user can easily reproduce the same analysis. The code is used to read, analyze and plot photoluminescence spectra generated by the SpectraSuit software package.

The python scripts can be run on any standard python interpreter.

The file structure that is given should not be altered, and any additional data should be added to the SampleData directory. If the data is R-values then it should be placed in a tab delineated .txt file(Note that the TvR value files output by the Run.py script are already in this format). Runs of spectrasuit data should be placed in a folder whose name must be 7 characters long ie. LB00004. the text files outputted by the SpectraSuit program must be of the format LB00004_00001.txt as can be seen in the Sample data Folder.
